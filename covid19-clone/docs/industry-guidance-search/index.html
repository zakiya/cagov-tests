<h2 id="protect-workers">Protect your workers</h2>



<h3>Prevent worker exposure to COVID-19</h3>



<p>Employers are required to follow CalOSHA’s <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">emergency temporary standards</a> to prevent exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace.</p>



<p>Visit the <a href="https://saferatwork.covid19.ca.gov/employers/">Employers</a> page of saferatwork.covid19.ca.gov to learn more about workplace requirements like:</p>



<ul><li>Safety procedures</li><li>Training for workers on infection prevention</li><li>What to do in case of an infection or outbreak&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Review <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/responding-to-covid19-workplace--en.pdf">how to respond to COVID-19 cases</a> in your workplace and prevent further spread.</p>



<h3>Provide masks</h3>



<p>Wearing a <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/#top">mask or face covering</a> is required statewide in public or common spaces. Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. Find all requirements and exceptions to these rules in the industry guidance for your business. For more about masks, check CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">guidance for the use of face coverings</a>.</p>



<h3>Paid leave and other benefits</h3>



<p>It’s important that employees with COVID-19 know to stay home. Your sick leave policies need to support that. Make sure your workers know about paid leave and other options available to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>See a <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Comparison-COVID-19-Paid-Leave.html">comparison of COVID-19 paid leave</a> available for workers affected by COVID-19.&nbsp;</li><li>Check the <a href="https://www.labor.ca.gov/coronavirus2019/#chart">chart of benefits</a> available to workers impacted by COVID-19.</li></ul>



<h4>Childcare and family-friendly practices</h4>



<p>Workers need safe, reliable, and affordable childcare options during the COVID-19 response.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Use the <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-family-friendly-practices-employers--en.pdf">family-friendly practices for employers</a> to develop work-life balance policies that include childcare supports and workplace flexibility.</li><li>Make sure your workers know about <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-support-working-families--en.pdf">support for working families</a>.</li></ul>



<h2 id="ventilation">Ventilation for indoor operations</h2>



<p>All businesses permitted to operate indoors must follow the CDPH interim <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Interim-Guidance-for-Ventilation-Filtration-and-Air-Quality-in-Indoor-Environments.aspx">guidance for ventilation, filtration, and air quality</a>. This guidance includes practical steps your business can take to promote better ventilation, filtration, and air quality indoors to reduce the spread of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="outdoor-structures">Temporary structures for outdoor operations</h2>



<p>Restaurants and other businesses operating outdoors may wish to enclose outdoor temporary structures like tents and canopies to contain heat, avoid rain, or provide shade. Follow the CDPH <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Use-of-Temporary-Structures-for-Outdoor-Business-Operations.aspx">guidance for temporary structures</a> to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.</p>

The group stays together for all activities, including meals and recreation. And this group avoids contact with anyone not in their group.</p>
<p>Kids and adults in supervised care environments must be in groups as small as possible. Kids and supervising adults in one group must not physically interact with:</p>
<ul><li>Kids and supervising adults in other groups</li><li>Other facility staff</li><li>Parents of kids in other groups</li></ul>
<p>Practicing a cohort structure:</p>
<ul><li>Decreases opportunities for exposure to or transmission of the virus</li><li>Facilitates more efficient contact tracing in the event of a positive case</li><li>Allows for targeted testing, quarantine, and isolation of a single group instead of an entire population of kids and supervising adults</li></ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/small-groups-child-youth.aspx" title="open guidance related to cohorts page">guidance related to cohorts</a> of children and youth sets minimum guidelines for providing specialized, targeted support services, necessary in-person child supervision and limited instruction, and facilitation of distance learning in small group environments in ways that maintain the focus on health and safety to minimize transmission. This guidance enables schools to provide specialized services for students with disabilities and English learners, and in-person support for at-risk and high-need students.&nbsp;</p>
