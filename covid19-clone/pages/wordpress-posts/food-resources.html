<h2>Families with children</h2>



<h3>Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) food benefits</h3>



<p>WIC helps families get access to healthy foods and a lot more. WIC serves babies and children up to age 5, pregnant women, and new mothers. Parents, grandparents, foster parents, or guardians can enroll children up to their 5th birthday. Working families and migrant families can apply too.</p>



<p>From June to September 2021, families receiving WIC will have a temporary increase in their monthly WIC fruits and vegetables benefit.</p>



<p class="js-qa-answer">If you recently lost your job because of COVID-19, you can apply for WIC. You can also apply if your income has changed or you are unable to work, even temporarily due to COVID-19. </p>



<p>Visit <a class="external" href="http://www.myfamily.wic.ca.gov/">MyFamily.WIC.ca.gov</a>, or call <a href="tel:888‑942‑9675">1‑888‑942‑9675</a> (1‑888‑WIC‑WORKS) for more information. </p>



<h3>School meals and the ‘CA Meals for Kids’ app</h3>



<p><a class="external" href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/schooldirectory">Check your local school district</a>&nbsp;for information on how and where to receive free or reduced-cost school meals.</p>



<p>The CA Meals for Kids app can help students and families find meals.&nbsp;The app is free and can be downloaded from&nbsp;<a class="external" title="California meals for kids in Apple's App Store" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ca-meals-for-kids/id1327449394">Apple’s App Store</a>,&nbsp;<a class="external" title="California meals for kids in Google's Play Store" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.ca.cde.NSDMobileApp">Google’s Play Store</a>, and&nbsp;<a class="external" title="California meals for kids in Microsoft's App Store" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ca-meals-for-kids/9p7t6j276zz9">Microsoft’s App Store</a>.</p>



<h3>Pandemic EBT (P-EBT)</h3>



<p>Families with children who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals at school can get extra benefits to help buy food when schools are closed due to COVID-19. These food benefits are called Pandemic EBT or P-EBT. Families with children under age 6 that receive CalFresh food benefits are also eligible. Students can still pick up to-go school meals even if they receive P-EBT benefits.</p>



<p>P-EBT does not:</p>



<ul><li>Require sign-up or an application</li><li>Affect other benefits you may be receiving</li><li>Impact immigration or make the recipient a public charge</li></ul>



<p>Visit the <a href="https://ca.p-ebt.org/">P-EBT website</a> for more information about this program.</p>



<p>P-EBT cards are automatically mailed directly to families with eligible children. Make sure your child’s school has their most current mailing address on file. </p>



<p>P-EBT cards work the same as CalFresh EBT cards. You can <a href="#EBT-cards-work-online">use them online</a>.</p>



<p>If you need help, call the P-EBT Helpline at <a href="tel:877-328-9677">877-328-9677</a> (M-F, 6 am to 8 pm).</p>
